# Cipher-Project
Cipher Encryption Program

/** READ-ME FOR KEYS:
 * When inputting keys, they MUST be in XX format to work.
 * This means instead of 1, it must be 01.
 * An example key with no diagonal swaps for the sub-blocks: 010203040506070809
   
*/

*** CURRENTLY ONLY TAKES 12 CHARACTERS FOR ENCRYPTION (just to get barebones of project idea) BUT CAN EASILY BE ADJUSTED
